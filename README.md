# individual-misID
simulations to evaluate the effect of error type and frequency on survival estimates  
  
change inputs for study length, error rate, survival, detection, sample size to evaluate the effects of misID under different scenarios  
  
Program MARK must be installed to use the RMark package to fit CJS models  
  
A word of warning:  

- simulations can take a while to run (a few hours for 100 reps), I recommended starting with a small number of reps to see how long it will take on your machine  
- RMark generates lots of output files in the working directory. I don't know how to prevent this from happening, if you know please let me know
